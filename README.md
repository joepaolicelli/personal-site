The 2025 update of my personal portfolio site.

Built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/), which is _waaayyy_ overkill for a portfolio, but allowed me to use a development and deployment workflow I was already working with. It also allowed for easy integration of modules like [Motion for Vue](https://motion.dev/) and [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/). Styling uses [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/).

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Deploy

Automated via GitHub Actions and NuxtHub. Alternatively:

```bash
npx nuxthub deploy
```
